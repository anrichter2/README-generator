## Description

For this project a traveler wanted me to create a weather displaying dashboard so that they could better plan their future trips. The traveler wanted to be able to input a city name and then be shown both the current weather for that city as well as the forecasted weather for the next five days. The important weather data that the traveler wanted included in the dashboard was an icon displaying the weather condition, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The traveler aslo wanted there to be a section of buttons that represented their previous searches so that they could easily and quickly look back at previous cities that they searched.

## Installation

Open the terminal and run npm install so that you get the inquirer dependency to load up. From there the application should run.

## Usage

After installing inquirer you type node index.js into the terminal, and the terminal will ask a series of questions that will generate the README file.

Below are screenshots showing my weather dashboard website.
