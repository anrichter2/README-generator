# README-generator

## Description

For this project the ultimate goal was to create a README file generator that could be used to create README files for other projects.

## Installation

Open the terminal and run npm install so that you get the inquirer dependency to load up. From there the application should run.

## Usage

After installing inquirer you type node index.js into the terminal, and the terminal will ask a series of questions that will generate the README file.

Below are screenshots showing a generated README file.
